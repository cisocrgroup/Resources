# Lexica
Lexical resources for the language-aware OCR document error profiler together with a Makefile to build the necessary binaries. See the [Profiler Manual][profman] for a description.

Currently, we serve lexica for classical Latin, German (both modern and historical) and Ancient Greek.

Further historical lexica for other languages may be obtained from the repository of the IMPACT Centre of Competence at <http://www.digitisation.eu/tools-resources/language-resources/>.

## German

The lexica for historical German have been compiled at CIS during the IMPACT (2008-2012) project. The corresponding research is described in the following references:

## Latin
The current Latin lexicon has been constructed by "unmunching" (for the procedure see the [profiler manual][profman]) the [LibreOffice spellchecking Latin lexicon provided by Karl Zeiler][zeilatin] by taking his "classical lexicon" and taking out all wordforms where u has been replaced by v, both from the .dic-file and the .aff-file rules (this reduplication of wordforms is unnecessary as we have the historical rewrite rules u:v, v:u in our pattern list). Thereby the number of entries in la.dic (lemmata and those inflections needed for constructing full paradigms) was reduced from 129.290 to 84.882, the number of suffix rules alone from 11.136 to 7.776 and the number of wordforms in the final lexicon (each 4 times, naked plus attached with the enclitics -que, -ne, -ve) from an artificially inflated 20 million to 8.4 million. Discounting the enclitic forms, this corresponds to 2.1 million word forms for classical Latin contained in this lexicon.

The work at CIS on the larger, 70k classical lemmata containing Berlin Latin Lexicon (BLL) will soon be made available here as well. See its description in:

In Proceedings of the First International Conference on Digital Access to Textual Cultural Heritage, pp. 71-75. ACM, 2014.

## Ancient Greek
The Ancient Greek lexicon stems from a tokenized list of Greek wordforms from the [Perseus Project][perseus].
